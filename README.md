# Deno Dinosaurs App

A simple application built with Deno using their Guide that displays a list of dinosaurs. When a dinosaur's name is clicked, additional information about that dinosaur is shown on a new page. This project demonstrates the basics of using Deno to serve web pages, handle routes, and work with JSON data.

## Overview

The Deno Dinosaurs app is a simple, educational project designed to introduce developers to Deno, a secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime built on V8. Similar to Node.js but with modern enhancements, Deno provides a streamlined way to work with server-side JavaScript.

The application has two main components:
1. **Dino List**: A main page that displays a list of dinosaur names from a JSON dataset.
2. **Dino Details**: Clicking on a dinosaur's name loads a separate page with more details about that specific dinosaur.

## Features

- **Dino List**: Displays all dinosaur names from a JSON dataset on the main page.
- **Dino Details**: Clicking on a dinosaur name loads a separate page with information like period, diet, and other details.
- **JSON Data Handling**: Dinosaur data is stored in a JSON file, demonstrating basic file reading and serving in Deno.

## Technologies Used

- **Deno**: A JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic styling and layout for web pages.
- **JSON**: Data format for dinosaur information storage.
